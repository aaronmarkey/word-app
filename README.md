# Word App
> A terminal-based word browsing application.

## Requirement:
- Python 3.11

## Installation
1. Download/clone
2. In root of project: `poetry install`

### Usage
To use, run `poetry run textual run word_app/__main__.py`.

## Development
- Install with the `dev` group (`poetry install --with dev`).
- Develop like a normal python application.
  - I don't really care for unit testingâ€”wasteful enterprise nonsense.
    So, you'll not find any tests and I won't be listening to arguments for
    wasting my limited time on them.
  - There's no process for contributing, if you end up contributing:
    1. Fork.
    2. Branch from `main`.
    3. Develop.
    4. Open a PR to merge into `main`.
      - No promises on if/when I'll review PRs. Bug me at <markeyaaron@pm.me>.

### Makefile
Check `Makefile` for commonly used commands.
